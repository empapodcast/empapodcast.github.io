# Romel D. Mackelprang

I am a junior faculty member in the University of Washington
Department of Global Health.  My research uses data science,
bioinformatics and epidemiology to elucidate host genomic factors that
contribute to infectious disease transmission and pathogenesis, with a
primary focus on HIV-1.
